# MBTI Spotify Playlist
**Comparing, pair to pair, the mean audio features of playlists associated to each MBTI type. (An exploration for future research)**
Note: The original data source for this project was Kaggle's repo: https://www.kaggle.com/code/xtrnglc/spotify-mbti-playlist-data-mining-and-engineering.

## Motivation
This repository represents the culmination of my final Codecademy portfolio project, as well as a precursor to my upcoming bachelor's degree academic paper in Psychology. My objective with this project, and those to come, is to merge three of my passions: Mathematics, Psychology, and Music. My ultimate aim is to enhance mental health measurement capabilities, since the approach of solely relying on questionnaires and therapist assessments might be insufficient (Ormel J. et al., 2022).
In the future, I plan to delve into areas such as NLP, narrative identity construction, mood tracking, predicting personality traits based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and more, all from a data-driven perspective.

## A Playful Prototype...
Far from having dealt with real subjects, this analysis has been done using mean playlist's audio features associated to each of the 16 MBTI types. Eventhough having 270 playlist with more than 30 songs within each one for all of the 16 types, we cannot assume that real subjects falling in those categories will fit into the study's conclusions. We could argue, almost constructing a musical super-ego, that this playlists are a manifestation of archetypical assumtions, a kind of listening style expectation for each MBTI type. In a way, INTJs will be in the dark conspiring while ESTPs will be having cocktails in a local beach volleyball tournament so the music in the created playlists will be chosen accordingly to this assumptions.  However, what I've tried to do is, far from predicting (for the moment), set  research guidelines for future more in depth investigations. That being said, if you're interested in contributing to this project or related endeavors, please don't hesitate to get in touch. The more the brains the better the ends.

Far from dealing with actual subjects, this analysis has been conducted using the mean audio features of playlists associated with each of the 16 MBTI types. Even though there are 270 playlists (each containing more than 30 songs) for all 16 types, we cannot assume that real subjects falling into those personality categories will align with the study's conclusions. Instead, we could argue that these playlists serve as a manifestation of archetypal assumptions (a sort of expected listening style for each MBTI type). In a playful analogy, INTJs might immerse themselves in mysterious musings while ESTPs could be enjoying music at a local beach volleyball tournament; therefote, the music in the created playlists has been selected fitting those expectations.

However, it's important to clarify that my intent here is not to predict outcomes (at least not at this stage), but rather to establish research guidelines for more in depth investigations in the future. With that said, if you're interested in contributing to this project or related endeavors, please don't hesitate to reach out. The more minds involved, the better the outcomes.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this.
